# TLDT-Java-
TLDT, short for The Legend of the Darkest Dungeon, is a game similar to that of Zork. Developed with Java.

As Lead Developer of the group project, I made most of the code that contributed to this, excluding  
the script and the strings that construct the story of the game. Features 13 commands, 27 rooms,  
monsters, and puzzles!
